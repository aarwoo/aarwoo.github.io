<a href="Standard Fx.pdf">The Standard of Fx is coming!!!</a><br>
<a href="Standard Fx.docx">See the future Standard of Fx</a><br> 
NOTE:<br>
In the future, I will introduce the generic programming into Fx.<br>
For example, express any value plus a value which type is _err:<br>
    <code>?+_err:(l,r)=>{r}|</code><br>
I had found my programming language is unusable because of design errors.<br>
The compiler or interpreter of Fx has not be created but I'll create its interpreter in the future.<br>
At last,thanks to all people who gave me a hand.<br>
