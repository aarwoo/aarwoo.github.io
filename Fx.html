<a href="Standard Fx.pdf">The Standard of Fx is coming!!!</a>
<a href="Standard Fx.docx">See the future Standard of Fx</a>
NOTE:
In the future, I will introduce the generic programming into Fx.
For example, express any value plus a value which type is _err:
    <code>?+_err:(l,r)=>{r}|</code>
I had found my programming language is unusable because of design errors.
The compiler or interpreter of Fx has not be created <wbr>but I'll create its interpreter in the future.
At last,thanks to all people who gave me a hand.
