<a href="Standard Fx.pdf">the Standard of Fx</a><br>
NOTE:<br>
The Standard Fx.pdf will be updated without updating this pages.<br>
I had found my programming language is unusable because of design errors.<br>
The compiler or interpreter of Fx has not be created but I'll create its interpreter in the future.<br>
This File is available but useless.<br>
I sent an email to some experts who pointed out that this document lacked an introduction.<br>
Thanks to them:  Bjarne Stroustrup,Yin Wang!
